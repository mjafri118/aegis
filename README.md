The number of reported criminal incidents on college campuses exceeds 27,500 and increases at 2% annually. When students feel unsafe, current technologies fail to provide desired safety assurance. This is especially apparent in females attending colleges in metropolitan areas.

Using publicly available crime data from city datasets, we set out to build an accessible means by which users in metropolitan areas can visualize potential dangers along their walking path.

We relied heavily on Google Cloud's Map's Places and Direction APIs, as well as using their storage and Cloud Function functionalities to host some models and live computations. We brought this all together via React Native for a seamless UX on both Android and PC.
